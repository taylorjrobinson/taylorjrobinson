### Hi there 💃🏽💁🏽‍♀️

I am a PhD student in Population Health Sciences at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in the Social and Behavioral Sciences Department. I study spatial and social epidemiology, and I'm interested in connecting housing policies and neighborhood-specific factors to racial disparities in respiratory conditions (namely sleep and asthma). My work centers housing safety issues, chronic neighborhood disinvestment, and other forms neighborhood processes such as segregation and gentrification. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on measuring neighborhood disorder in Boston, MA, linking extreme heat to sleep problems, studying the relationship between structural racism and cardiovascular disease, and generally trying to explore how factors in the housing policy space can be brought into public health. 


- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning via BST 260 Intro to Data Science 

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on on projects re structural racism, housing policy or housing inequalities, and sleep epidemiology
